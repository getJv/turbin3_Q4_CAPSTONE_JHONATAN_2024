# Solana Minesweeper

Solana Minesweeper brings the classic, beloved Windows Minesweeper into the
future, now powered by Solana blockchain.

Just like the arcade days, players will need to "insert a coin" to begin each match.
Every playerâ€™s actions and high scores are securely stored on the blockchain, adding a layer of transparency and
trust.

In the upcoming update, the game will introduce a multiplayer cooperative
mode, allowing players to team up and increase the excitement and interaction.
Get ready for a new era of Minesweeper, where tradition meets cutting-edge
technology!
